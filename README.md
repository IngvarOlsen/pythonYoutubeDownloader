# Simple Python Youtube Downloader

Simple Python YouTube downloader with pytube with input for youtube link and output path.
It downloads with highest possible resolution

Made it  for my dad, as allot of youtube downloader sites are pretty dodgy 


Dependencies 
Python 3.6 or greater
```
pip install pytube
```

Click the startScript.BAT file, or run it in CMD 
```
python youtubeDownloader.py
```
